Description: Money doesn't grow on trees. Arbitrage opportunities do.
    Find the best arbitrage opportunities (arbs) in sports matches through
    <https://www.oddschecker.com/>. This package allows the user to input
    the URLs of <https://www.oddschecker.com/> subdomains in order to extract
    any opportunities for arbitrage. The majority of the functionality is
    implemented using the function `get_arbs_shiny()`, which simply provides an
    easy-to-use interface wrapping the functionality of the `get_arbs()` function.
    This function first finds all subdomains of the URL entered, then filters to
    only include those that look like event betting pages. Next, odds are scraped
    from the various bookmakers listed for that event, before returning 
    combinations of bookmakers, odds or outcomes that could be used for arbitrage.
    Bets placed subsequently are done so at bettor's risk. Please see 
    package README for full details.
