Description: Money doesn't grow on trees. Arbitrage opportunities do.
    Find the best arbitrage opportunities (arbs) in sports matches through
    <https://www.oddschecker.com/>. This package allows the user to input
    the URLs of <https://www.oddschecker.com/> subdomains in order to find
    any opportunities for arbitrage. The majority of the functionality is
    implemented using the function \code{get_arbs()}. This function first
    finds all subdomains of the URL entered, then filters to only include
    those that look like event betting pages. Next, odds are scraped from
    the various bookmakers listed for that event, before returning combinations
    of bookmakers, odds or outcomes that could be used for arbitrage. Bets
    placed subsequently are done so at bettor's risk and we take no
    responsibility for losses that may occur from use of this package. Odds
    subject to instantaneous changes.
