#' Find arbitrage opportunity information for an www.oddschecker.com event
#'
#' Find (among other information) the implied total probability of all listed
#' outcomes, Pr(Omega), and if an arb is available, the best bookie combination
#' to exploit the arb.
#'
#' This function assumes that the listed outcomes are the only ones that are possible.
#' Sometimes bookies may not offer odds on a realistic outcome, often if they feel like
#' it is extremely likely to happen and therefore would offer next to no returns for
#' any punter. This may mean that an outcome isn't listed and thus the function assumes it
#' isn't possible. Therefore, the results of this function may be incorrect and assume
#' a huge arbs is possible, when it isn't. It is therefore required that the user check
#' the given outcomes given in the results, to ensure they form a complete set. Often, this
#' is obvious however, as they are simply win, draw or lose.
#'
#' @param event A www.oddschecker.com event URL, given as a string. This will be of the form:
#' "https://www.oddschecker.com/football/english/championship/bournemouth-v-reading/winner"
#'
#' @param full A logical indicating whether or not the best bookie choices should
#' still be returned for the event, even if there is no arb available.
#'
#' @param print_urls Logical. Should the url of the event(s) be printed to the console while
#' searching for arbitrage opportunities?
